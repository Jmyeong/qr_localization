# qr_localization
Precise Localization with QR_code Package by team factorial	<br/>
This package uses QR_Code for landmarks when implementing pure_localization on cartographer <br/>
This can enhance accuracy of global localization <br/>
Also can do pose estimation with no initial delay (Original cartographer has initial delay for scan matching)

# How to use
# 1. Prepare your camera calibration file to "./camera_param" <br/>
