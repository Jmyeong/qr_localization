# qr_localization
Precise Localization with QR_code Package by team factorial\n
This package uses QR_Code for landmarks when implementing pure_localization on cartographer\n
This can enhance accuracy of global localization\n
Also can do pose estimation with no initial delay (Original cartographer has initial delay for scan matching)

# How to use
